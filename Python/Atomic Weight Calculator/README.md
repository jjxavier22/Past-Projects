compound.py calculates the atomic weight of molecules.

longcompound.py expands compound.py to print the names of the elements in the compound, which are in the third field of the file “atomic_weights.txt”. If an element occurs twice, the element is listed only once. The elements are printed in sorted order, using proper grammar.

The file “atomic_weights.txt” contains lines with three fields separated by tabs. The first field is the atomic weight, the second field is the symbol for the element, and the third field is the name of the element. The contents of this file will be loaded into a dictionary to be used for the calculations.
