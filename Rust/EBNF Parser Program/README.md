This Rust program parses an example language following the rules of EBNF (Extended Backusâ€“Naur Form). The example language is similar to the C language, but is simpler and slightly different. In a way this program behaves as a compiler checking if the inputted txt file conforms to EBNF rules and is free of any syntax errors using a Lexical Analyzer.
