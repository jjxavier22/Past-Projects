For this project, we develop an artificial neural network to classify data given in the Dry Beans Data Set. This data set was obtained as a part of a research study by Selcuk University, Turkey, in which a computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features. More details on the study can be found in the following research paper.
