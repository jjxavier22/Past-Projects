Adapted from Sam King's "dcash wallet" project

For this project you will write a command-line wallet, called `dcash`
for sending money to people. The main components of this project are
(1) command-line wallet application for interacting directly with
users, (2) a API server, based on [Gunrock
Web](https://github.com/kingst/gunrock_web), for supporting your
wallet, and (3) API calls to Stripe for charging credit cards.
