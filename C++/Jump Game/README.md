Mathew Butner's Jump Game Programming Problem

You are given a list of integer numbers. Each number tells you how far to the right or left you can move from that spot. You can only move exactly that many spaces. Moving from one number to the next is considered a move. Your goal is to find the sequence of moves that get you from the first number to the last number in the fewest moves possible. If however, there is no sequence of moves that will get you to the end, then you should state that. For example, if you were given the list

Then the smallest sequence of moves that gets you from index 0 to index 6 is {0, 1, 3, 2, 6}.
