Concatenation: concat(L1, L2, L): meaning the concatenation of two lists L1 and L2 is L.
Element_At: element_at(X, N, L): meaning the element X is the Nth element in list L.
Reverse: my_reverse(L1, L2): meaning the reverse of list L1 is L2.
Flatten: my_flatten(L1, L2): Given a list L1, its flattened version is L2.
Compress: compress(L1, L2): Given a list L1, L2 is its compressed version by eliminating the duplicates.
