Given an NxN chessboard, the goal is place N queens on the board so that no two queens can attack one another. In Chess, a queen can attack another piece vertically, horizontally and diagonally. In other words, no two queens can be placed on the same row, on the same column, or on the same diagonal. For more details, please check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle.

The program NQueens defines the predicate queens(N, Q) where N is the number of rows and columns of the chessboard, and Q is a list N numbers such that the ith number represents the position of the queen in column i. For example, Q = [4, 2, 7, 3, 6, 8, 5, 1] means that the queen in the first column is in row 4, the queen in the second column is in row 2, etc.
